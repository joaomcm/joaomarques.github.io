In this short paper, we discuss the main features of our semifinals entry to the ANA Avatar XPrize challenge in Miami, Florida, which placed 4th in the semifinals. Most crucially, our system was free of any cumbersome exoskeletons, while still performing among the top 5 robots at this stage, by having an intuitive and robust user interface.

A more detailed paper with our finals submission will follow soon.
