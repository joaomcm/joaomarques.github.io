This is my master's thesis! In it, I designed a point-and-command interface to enable issuing grasping commands to a robot without requiring any data for training an image segmentation algorithm. We implement and adapt a graph-theory based image segmenter to use RGBD images from a Kinect. In the end, we were able to grasp fully novel objects (including a freshly bought banana) - all while running on an old laptop.
