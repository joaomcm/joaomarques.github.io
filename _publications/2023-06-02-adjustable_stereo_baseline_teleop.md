excerpt: "Depth perception plays an important role in teleoperated task completion. Most previous works on teleoperated depth perception with Head Mounted Displays had focused their attention on matching the user's Intra-Pupillary Distance (IPD) on the HMD's displays, but used fixed stereo cameras on the robot side to capture the environment. In this workahop paper, we developed a custom adjustable baseline stereo rig for use in teleoperated robotics and show, through a small user study (n=16), that matching the robot's stereo baseline with the user's IPD has a small, but significant effect in task completion time for depth-critical operations. This suggests that future Avatar design could benefit from robot-side IPD adjustment devices, especially for fine manipulation tasks. We also observed that scaling the number of Degrees of Freedom on an avatar's neck showed diminishing returns after 2 DoFs, hinting that commercial pan-tilt units might be sufficient for most avatar applications, though more research is needed with a more diverse task set."
