excerpt: 'This workshop paper presents the techniques and technologies we employed in our successful entry on the ANA Avatar XPrize finals, in 2022 in Los Angeles. Our team, AvaTRINA, placed 4<sup>th</sup> overall, being the only team to complete the full obstacle course without the use of any bulky Load Force Feedback devices on the operator`s arms. We believe augmented reality and assistive teleoperation modes are one viable path towards scalable and equitable adoption of avatar technologies.'
